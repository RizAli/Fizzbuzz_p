gem install rspec
rspec --h
rspec -init

fizzbuzz_spec.rb

To keep our production files and test files separate, I created  a folder called lib.
now in this file I will be defining all the methods.

touch ./lib/fizzbuzz.rb
write first test.

1. Create .travis.yml file on the root of the project folder.
2. added content in the travis file
